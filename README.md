## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Description

This app is for anyone who's looking for an easy way to track and review their exercises. It allows the user to add new workouts with multiple exercises per workout, then review their past 7 days of workouts with helpful charts and graphs to visualize the data.
